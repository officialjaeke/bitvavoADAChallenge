# bitvavoADAChallenge
initiated from the idea of @nierop_pieter on twitter of buying a set amount of ADA every single day on the exchange bitvavo (easy access for dutch people)

# notes
bitvavo only accepts orders of 5 eur or more, make sure you are willing to spend this amount each day

### to-do
* ~build api~
* ~buyADA function~
* ~checkBalance function~
* logging/debugging
* write guide
* build docker container to run every day
